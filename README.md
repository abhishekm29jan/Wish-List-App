## 🎯 Wishlist App

The **Wishlist App** is a modern Android application developed using **Kotlin**, **Jetpack Compose**, and follows the **MVVM (Model-View-ViewModel)** architecture pattern. This project serves as a practical demonstration of clean architecture, **object-oriented programming (OOP)** concepts, and modern Android development tools and practices.

### 🛠️ Tech Stack & Tools

* 💻 **Kotlin** – Primary language used for Android development.
* 🧱 **Jetpack Compose** – For building declarative, responsive UIs.
* 🏗️ **MVVM Architecture** – Clean separation of concerns using ViewModel and Repository.
* 🗃️ **Room Database** – Local storage for persisting user data.
* 🔄 **Coroutines & Flow** – For asynchronous data operations.
* 📦 **DAO (Data Access Object)** – Manages SQLite operations cleanly.

### 💡 Concepts Used

This app demonstrates:

* **OOP Principles** – Includes abstraction, inheritance, and clean class design.
* **Separation of Concerns** – ViewModel handles logic, Composables handle UI.
* **Lifecycle Awareness** – ViewModel and Flow help keep the app responsive and efficient.

### 🎓 Ideal For:

* Beginners learning modern Android development.
* Understanding MVVM, Room, and Jetpack Compose together in one project.
* Practicing clean code and architecture patterns.
